## Usage

To launch this lab, you need to open a shell and type:

```

It will first install all the necessary depedencies and will then start a server on the port 3000 of the localhost. You can then access it by typing `localhost:3000` or `127.0.0.1:3000` in your favorite web browser.\
This should open a simple web client in which you can type and submit messages that will appear on screen.
